# time-entry-divider
A simple app for lawyers to divide their time entries into tasked narratives without doing mental math.  Attorneys bill by the tenth of an hour, creating time entries every day showing the time worked on a matter and a narrative description of the work. Some clients refuse to accept "block billing", which is the practice of lumping several discrete tasks into a single, often vaguely worded time entry.  Instead, they require that the lawyer either bill separate entries or include discrete tasks in the narrative with associated time increments. 
 Although this is understandable, actually billing by the task and dividing the narrative is annoying and cumbersome for lawyers.  This app helps make that annoyance slightly better by facilitating the task-narrative process and automatically calculating the task time.
